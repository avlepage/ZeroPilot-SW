/**
 * Implements UART driver for the available ports on the chip
 * By default configures for both tx and rx, with an 8-bit data size

 *
 *  Notes on DMA:
 *  - You should only setup DMA on the interface if you're expecting to receive constant size packets. Variable size
 *  packets may work, however then you should pick a common multiple of the different sizes of packets. This is because
 *  a DMA interrupt only triggers when the buffer is half full or full, so if the device has sent data that doesn't fill
 *  the buffer, you'll have to wait until enough bytes are received before being able to read it!
 *
 *  Note that this isn't an issue when sending TX through DMA (just make sure that the dma send buffer is large enough to
 *  fill your largest packet
